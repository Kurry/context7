# Context7 MCP - Up-to-date Code Docs For Any Prompt

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-context7.com-blue)](https://context7.com)

## ‚ùå Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ‚ùå Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ‚ùå Hallucinated APIs that don't even exist
- ‚ùå Generic answers for old package versions

## ‚úÖ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source ‚Äî and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM's context.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write your prompt naturally
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get working code answers

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don't exist, no outdated code generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 13.0+ (for Swift implementation)
- Swift 6.0+ (Xcode 16+)
- Cursor, Claude Code, VSCode, Windsurf or another MCP Client
- Context7 API Key (Optional) for higher rate limits (Get yours at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard))

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/upstash/context7.git
cd context7
swift build
```

2. **Run the server:**
```bash
swift run context7-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

3. **Configure your MCP client:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "swift",
      "args": ["run", "context7-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/context7"
    }
  }
}
```

## üî® Available Tools

Context7 MCP provides the following tools that LLMs can use:

- `resolve-library-id`: Resolves a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for

- `get-library-docs`: Fetches documentation for a library using a Context7-compatible library ID.
  - `context7CompatibleLibraryID` (required): Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/vercel/next.js`)
  - `topic` (optional): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., "routing", "hooks")
  - `tokens` (optional, default 5000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than 1000 are automatically increased to 1000.

## üõü Tips

### Add a Rule

If you don't want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your MCP client's rule section:

```txt
Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
```

### Use Library Id

If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt:

```txt
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
```

The slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.

## üíª Development

### Swift Development

Clone the project and build:

```bash
swift build
```

Run tests:

```bash
swift test
```

Build for release:

```bash
swift build -c release
```

The executable will be available at `.build/release/context7-mcp`.

### CLI Arguments

`context7-mcp` accepts the following CLI flags:

- `--api-key <key>` ‚Äì API key for authentication (or set `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` env var)

Example with API key:

```bash
swift run context7-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Environment Variables

You can use the `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing the `--api-key` flag.

**Example with .env file:**

```bash
# .env
CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Swift-Specific Issues

1. **Swift Version**: Ensure you're using Swift 6.0+ (Xcode 16+)
2. **macOS Version**: Requires macOS 13.0+ for full async/await support
3. **Build Issues**: Try `swift package clean` and rebuild

### General MCP Client Errors

1. Ensure you're using a compatible MCP client
2. Check that the Swift executable path is correct
3. Verify your API key is valid and starts with 'ctx7sk'
